# Figma MCP Test

This repository demonstrates using the Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP) to convert a Figma design to web code.

## About This Project

This implementation is based on a Figma design that contains a simple image element. The code has been automatically generated using Claude AI via the Figma Model Context Protocol.

## Design Source

Original Figma design: [Untitled](https://www.figma.com/design/5ddpJqH2rQ7MzzEdloMhSX/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=bECzUQGbmpEMhCDd-1)

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

- Responsive HTML/CSS layout
- Simple, clean styling with box-shadow effects
- Mobile-friendly design with media queries

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with the page structure
- `styles.css`: CSS styling for the page
- `assets/`: Directory containing the image from the Figma design

## How To View

1. Clone the repository
2. Download the image from Figma and place it in the `assets/` directory as `image1.png`
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser

## Next Steps

This is a simple example of Figma-to-code conversion. Future improvements could include:
- Adding more complex UI elements
- Implementing interactive features with JavaScript
- Creating a full responsive website
